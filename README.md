# Description of the project 
The idea behind our project was to create mini piano using Arduino. Since we wanted each button to play one note and have many keys, we decided to use multiplexer for the inputs instead of connecting each button/key directly to Arduino pins. Ultimately the piano designed by us has a range of C4 -Bb4 (chromatic scale) which is 11 keys, but with this design its possible for the maximum of 16 keys through multiplexer + 8 with the Arduino pins which are unused, which gives us maximum of 24 keys (almost 2 octaves). 

For the sound we have desided to use a DFPlayer mini with SIM card where the mp3 files of each note is stored and a simple speaker connected to it.

How it works:

Multiplexer:

We have got a multiplexer with 11 out of 16 of the inputs connected to each button. Every button is also powered with constant voltage of 5V and when the button is pressed, the high voltage can be read by Arduino. We have also got a pull-down resistor so when button is not pressed, the voltage read by Arduino is 0V. 
To read the signal we must also connect multiplexer to Arduino: outputs S0 to S3 are connected to pins 13 to 10 (see the code below), SIG to A0, EN and GND to ground and VCC to 5V.

In the code we use "void MuxChannel(byte channel)" to select a multiplexer channel. When the channel is selected we can
